# Close-Domain fine-tuning for table detection

In this project, we show the benefits of using models trained on a close domain, using the [TableBank dataset](https://github.com/doc-analysis/TableBank), for fine-tuning table detection models. 


## Results for TableBank

We have trained several models for the LaTeX part of the TableBank dataset using the Mask-RCNN [Heras], RetinaNet, SSD and YOLO
